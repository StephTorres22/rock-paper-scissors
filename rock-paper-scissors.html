        /* Game is to be played against the computer. So need a note for the computer choice, and a way for the user to input a choice.
        Need to tell program that:
        1. Rock is greater than scissors
        2. Scissors is greater than paper,
        3. Paper is greater than rock.
        4. A match is equal.

        computerPlay() function needs to produce a random result of the three options to be compared against a user choice.
        computer choice should only be known at comparison outcome.

        1st problem. random, generation of options for comp.
        Do you declare an array with the options, take one at random, a bit like word app*/

            //multiply by the array length, in this case 3, now become random between 0 - 3.
            //Math.floor, rounds this down to the nearest whole number
            // does this method mean that 3 is the least likely to be called....?
